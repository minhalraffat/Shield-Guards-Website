    <p id="font2">Everything we do is focused on our clients. We are all about service excellence and mark our progress as much by client 
        satisfaction and retention rates as by our own financial performance. Our FM contract retention stands at above 90%. We are working

            Then, as the client experiences the value we bring to the business, the relationship evolves into a bundle of services or a fully integrated contract which sees us deliver a raft of different services under a single agreement.

            In addition to initiatives such as the Key Accounts programme – which although part of our People strategy also delivers tangible benefits to clients – we strive to create a culture that always puts client focus at the heart of how we work.

            In the complex outsourcing marketplace, it is clear that one size will never fit all. So we treat each client as unique; as an opportunity to create a tailored service – or a bundle of services – that meet their needs with pinpoint precision.

            Client focus means creating a clear simple message that resonates for one client and one client alone. This is uniquely tailored and demonstrates a real understanding of where they are, the pressures they are under and how the services we provide can be linked together in ways that unlock potential and deliver new benefits.

        <p id="font4">Our team continually seeks out new and better ways of working. That means concentrating on what matters most to customers, listening to feedback and being innovative to meet ever-increasing expectations. It means efficient delivery, using standard processes, key performance metrics and knowing exactly who is doing what, where and when. And it means being effective, with clearly defined roles and a culture of continuous improvement supported by sharing best practice, such as how we use management information and technology.

            Technology is also a key driver for efficiency improvement. Our teams have a long track record of deploying innovative tools to enhance performance, from remote surveillance systems to our Miworld portal which enables clients to monitor and manage all their buildings and equipment in one place, in real time. During 2014, we launched a number of new technology-led initiatives, including the security industry’s first ‘all incident’ crime mapping software. This brings together our recorded security incidents and police crime data in an online, UK-wide registry to provide the most up-to-date intelligence and analytics.</p>
